1)A day without laughter is a day wasted-Charlie Chaplin

2)Analyzing humor is like dissecting a frog. Few people are interested and the frog dies of it. -E. B. White

3)A sense of humor... is needed armor. Joy in one's heart and some laughter on one's lips is a sign that the person down deep has a pretty good grasp of life-Hugh Sidey
